{
  "Helaman 1:1": "And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.",
  "Helaman 1:2": "For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgement seat among the brethren, which were the sons of Pahoran.",
  "Helaman 1:3": "Now these are their names which did contend for the judgement seat, which did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.",
  "Helaman 1:4": "Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran, ( for he had many, ) but these are they which did contend for the judgement seat; therefore they did cause three divisions among the people.",
  "Helaman 1:5": "Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be a Chief Judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 1:6": "And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgement seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.",
  "Helaman 1:7": "But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceeding wroth; therefore he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.",
  "Helaman 1:8": "And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion, and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.",
  "Helaman 1:9": "Now when those people which were desirous that he should be their governor, saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry; and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgement seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgement seat.",
  "Helaman 1:10": "And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen, that no man could overtake him.",
  "Helaman 1:11": "And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran;",
  "Helaman 1:12": "therefore Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen, and his band which had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found, were condemned unto death.",
  "Helaman 1:13": "And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a Chief Judge and a govereor governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done, in the fortieth year of the reign of the Judges; and it had an end.",
  "Helaman 1:14": "And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of the Judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with headplates, and with breast-plates, and with all manner of shields of every kind;",
  "Helaman 1:15": "and they came down again, that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man;",
  "Helaman 1:16": "therefore the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron. Now Tubaloth supposing that Coriantumr, he being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, insomuch with his strength, and also with his great wisdom, that by sending him forth, he should gain power over the Nephites;",
  "Helaman 1:17": "therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla, to battle against the Nephites.",
  "Helaman 1:18": "And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.",
  "Helaman 1:19": "But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceeding great speed, that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies;",
  "Helaman 1:20": "therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city.",
  "Helaman 1:21": "And it came to pass that Pacumeni, which was the Chief Judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.",
  "Helaman 1:22": "And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage, insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.",
  "Helaman 1:23": "And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land;",
  "Helaman 1:24": "and supposing that their greatest strength was in the centre of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together, save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.",
  "Helaman 1:25": "But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the centre of the land, gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites which were slain;",
  "Helaman 1:26": "for behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the centre of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders, as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.",
  "Helaman 1:27": "But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the centre of the land, and had taken the capital city, which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strong holds.",
  "Helaman 1:28": "But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head them, before they should come to the land Bountiful:",
  "Helaman 1:29": "And thus he did; and he did head them, before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.",
  "Helaman 1:30": "And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle insomuch that it became an exceeding bloody battle; yea, many were slain; and among the number which were slain, Coriantumr was also found.",
  "Helaman 1:31": "And now behold the Lamanites could not retreat neither way; neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites:",
  "Helaman 1:32": "And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into the hands of the Nephites.",
  "Helaman 1:33": "And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites which had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.",
  "Helaman 1:34": "And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 2:1": "And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of the Judges, after Moronihah had established again the peace betweem the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgement seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgement seat.",
  "Helaman 2:2": "And it came to pass that Helaman, which was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgement seat, by the voice of the people;",
  "Helaman 2:3": "but behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, which had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness;",
  "Helaman 2:4": "for there was one Gadianton, who was exceeding expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen;",
  "Helaman 2:5": "therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgement seat, he would grant unto those which belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.",
  "Helaman 2:6": "And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgement seat, to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman.",
  "Helaman 2:7": "And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgement seat, that he might murder Helaman:",
  "Helaman 2:8": "And it came to pass that when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those which belonged to his band, to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, ( and this was their secret plan, and their combination, ) the servant of Helaman saith unto Kishkumen, Let us go forth unto the judgement seat.",
  "Helaman 2:9": "Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgement seat, did stab Kishkumen, even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.",
  "Helaman 2:10": "And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.",
  "Helaman 2:11": "But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return, he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them, they could no where be found.—",
  "Helaman 2:12": "And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 2:13": "And behold, in the end of this book, ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.—",
  "Helaman 2:14": "Behold I do not mean the end of the Book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the Book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.",
  "Helaman 3:1": "And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the Judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi, save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.",
  "Helaman 3:2": "And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.",
  "Helaman 3:3": "And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there were much contentions and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceeding great many which departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward, to inherit the land;",
  "Helaman 3:4": "and they did travel to an exceeding great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water, and many rivers;",
  "Helaman 3:5": "yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate, and without timber, because of the many inhabitants which had before inherited the land.",
  "Helaman 3:6": "And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber, & c.; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people which had before inhabited the land, it was called desolate.",
  "Helaman 3:7": "And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people which went forth, became exceeding expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.",
  "Helaman 3:8": "And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward, to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south, to the sea north, from the sea west, to the sea east.",
  "Helaman 3:9": "And the people which were in the land northward, did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land, that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.",
  "Helaman 3:10": "And it came to pass as timber was exceeding scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping;",
  "Helaman 3:11": "and thus they did enable the people in the land northward, that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.",
  "Helaman 3:12": "And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, which were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.",
  "Helaman 3:13": "And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them;",
  "Helaman 3:14": "but behold a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites, and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping, and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work;",
  "Helaman 3:15": "but behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites;",
  "Helaman 3:16": "and they have been handed down from one generation to another, by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression, and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 3:17": "And now I return again to mine account; therefore what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions among the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 3:18": "The forty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges ended.",
  "Helaman 3:19": "And it came to pass that there was still great contentions in the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year;",
  "Helaman 3:20": "nevertheless, Helaman did fill the judgement seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgements, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God, continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.",
  "Helaman 3:21": "And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest the name of Lehi. And they began to grow up unto the Lord.—",
  "Helaman 3:22": "And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 3:23": "And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the nobler robber had established, in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those which were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.",
  "Helaman 3:24": "And it came to pass that in this same year, there was exceeding great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church, and were baptized unto repentance;",
  "Helaman 3:25": "and so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the High Priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.—",
  "Helaman 3:26": "And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper, unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God many souls; yea, even tens of thousands.",
  "Helaman 3:27": "Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name;",
  "Helaman 3:28": "yea, thus we see that the gate of Heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, which is the Son of God;",
  "Helaman 3:29": "yea, we see that whosoever will lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning, and the snares, and the wiles of the Devil, and lead the man of Christ in a straight and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked,",
  "Helaman 3:30": "and land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God, in the kingdom of Heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.",
  "Helaman 3:31": "And in this year there were continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.",
  "Helaman 3:32": "And it came to pass that there was peace, and exceeding great joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 3:33": "And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the Judges, there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church; not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God;",
  "Helaman 3:34": "and they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction;",
  "Helaman 3:35": "nevertheless, they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.",
  "Helaman 3:36": "And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceeding great pride which had got into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceeding great riches, and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.",
  "Helaman 3:37": "And it came to pass, in the fifty and third year of the reign of the Judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgement seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.",
  "Helaman 4:1": "And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year, there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed;",
  "Helaman 4:2": "and the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 4:3": "And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceeding fraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.",
  "Helaman 4:4": "But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges, there were dissenters which went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.",
  "Helaman 4:5": "And in the fifty and seventh year, they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch, that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges, they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful;",
  "Helaman 4:6": "and the Nephites, and the armies of Moronihah, were driven even into the land of Bountiful;",
  "Helaman 4:7": "and there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the West Sea, even unto the East; it being a day’s journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.",
  "Helaman 4:8": "And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 4:9": "And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the Judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies, in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they retained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 4:10": "And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign of the Judges, they succeeded in retaining even the half of all their possessions.",
  "Helaman 4:11": "Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened, had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also which professed to belong to the church of God;",
  "Helaman 4:12": "and it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, steeling, committing adultery, raising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites;",
  "Helaman 4:13": "and because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted, and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.",
  "Helaman 4:14": "But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people, because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, which were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people; yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.",
  "Helaman 4:15": "And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent, they did begin to prosper;",
  "Helaman 4:16": "for when Moronihah saw that they did repent, he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had retained the one half of their property, and the one half of all their lands.",
  "Helaman 4:17": "And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 4:18": "And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign of the Judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites;",
  "Helaman 4:19": "therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous was the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.",
  "Helaman 4:20": "And it came to pass because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites, the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed;",
  "Helaman 4:21": "yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at nought the commandments of God;",
  "Helaman 4:22": "and that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and thus seeing that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 4:23": "And because of their iniquity, the church had began to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy, and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgements of God did stare them in the face.",
  "Helaman 4:24": "And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them, because the spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples;",
  "Helaman 4:25": "therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were more exceeding numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God, they must unavoidably perish.",
  "Helaman 4:26": "For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.",
  "Helaman 5:1": "And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgement seat, to a man whose name was Cezoram.",
  "Helaman 5:2": "For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of the people, and they which chose evil were more numerous than they which chose good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted;",
  "Helaman 5:3": "yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.",
  "Helaman 5:4": "And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary, because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgement seat, and took it upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days:",
  "Helaman 5:5": "for they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words which he spake:",
  "Helaman 5:6": "Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words: Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents, which came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done, that when you remember your names, that ye may remember them; and when ye remember them, ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works, ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good;",
  "Helaman 5:7": "therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.",
  "Helaman 5:8": "And now my sons, behold, I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in Heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.",
  "Helaman 5:9": "O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, which shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.",
  "Helaman 5:10": "And remember also, the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah: for he said unto him, That the Lord surely should come to redeem his people; but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.",
  "Helaman 5:11": "And he hath power given unto him from the Father, to redeem them from their sins, because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redemer, unto the salvation of their souls.—",
  "Helaman 5:12": "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, which is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation, that when the Devil shall send forth his mighty winds; yea, his shafts in the whirlwind; yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you, to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men buildeth, they cannot fall.",
  "Helaman 5:13": "And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.",
  "Helaman 5:14": "And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;",
  "Helaman 5:15": "and from thence forth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek;",
  "Helaman 5:16": "and even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi, which were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 5:17": "And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters which had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins, and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites, to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.",
  "Helaman 5:18": "And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority: for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak; and they also had what they should speak, given unto them;",
  "Helaman 5:19": "therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites which were in the land of Zarahemla and round about, baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.",
  "Helaman 5:20": "And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 5:21": "And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites, and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.",
  "Helaman 5:22": "And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them, that they might slay them.",
  "Helaman 5:23": "And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear, lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire, and were not burned.",
  "Helaman 5:24": "And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.",
  "Helaman 5:25": "For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement.",
  "Helaman 5:26": "And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth, and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that hath shewn unto you this marvellous thing, in the which is shewn unto you, that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.",
  "Helaman 5:27": "And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake, as if they were about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall. And behold, they that were in the prison, were Lamanites, and Nephites which were dissenters.",
  "Helaman 5:28": "And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of darkness, and an awful, solemn fear came upon them.",
  "Helaman 5:29": "And it came to pass that there came a voice, as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying, Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my servants which I have sent unto you to declare good tidings.",
  "Helaman 5:30": "And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder; neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise; but behold, it was a still voice, of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.",
  "Helaman 5:31": "And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice, behold, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold, the cloud of darkness which had overshadowed them, did not disperse.",
  "Helaman 5:32": "And behold, the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled;",
  "Helaman 5:33": "and also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvellous words, which cannot be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.",
  "Helaman 5:34": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee, because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable, because of the fear which did come upon them.",
  "Helaman 5:35": "Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God, but had dissented from them.",
  "Helaman 5:36": "And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the face of angels. And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to Heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being which they beheld.",
  "Helaman 5:37": "And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look. And behold, there was power given unto them, that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.",
  "Helaman 5:38": "And they said unto the man, Behold, what doth all these things mean? and who is it with whom these men do converse?",
  "Helaman 5:39": "Now the man’s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab saith unto them, They do converse with the angels of God.",
  "Helaman 5:40": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him, What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?",
  "Helaman 5:41": "And Aminadab saith unto them, You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, which was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and by Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.",
  "Helaman 5:42": "And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him which had shook the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness was dispersed.",
  "Helaman 5:43": "And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, and behold, they saw that they were encircled about, yea, every soul, by a pillar of fire.",
  "Helaman 5:44": "And Nephi and Lehi was in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.",
  "Helaman 5:45": "And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from Heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire; and they could speak forth marvellous words.",
  "Helaman 5:46": "And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying,",
  "Helaman 5:47": "Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my well beloved, which was from the foundation of the world.",
  "Helaman 5:48": "And now when they heard this, they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven, and ministered unto them.—",
  "Helaman 5:49": "And there were about three hundred souls which saw and heard these things; and they were bid to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.",
  "Helaman 5:50": "And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the people, declaring throughout all the regions round about, all the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidencess which they had received;",
  "Helaman 5:51": "and as many as were convinced, did lay down their weapons of war, and also their hatred, and the tradition of their fathers.",
  "Helaman 5:52": "And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites, the lands of their possession.",
  "Helaman 6:1": "And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of the Judges had ended, all these things had happened, and the Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness, and their steadiness in the faith.",
  "Helaman 6:2": "For behold, there were many of the Nephites which had become hardened, and impenitent, and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God, and all the preaching and prophecying which did come among them.",
  "Helaman 6:3": "Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy, because of the conversion of the Lamanites; yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them. And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.",
  "Helaman 6:4": "And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of their conversion, and did exhort them to faith and repentance;",
  "Helaman 6:5": "yea, and many did preach with exceeding great power and authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.",
  "Helaman 6:6": "And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto the people. And thus ended the sixty and third year.",
  "Helaman 6:7": "And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 6:8": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one with another, for to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to their desire.",
  "Helaman 6:9": "And it came to pass that they became exceeding rich, both the Lamanites and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south, and in the land north.",
  "Helaman 6:10": "Now the land south was called Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek, which was after the sons of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.",
  "Helaman 6:11": "And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there was also curious workmen, which did work all kinds of ore, and did refine it; and thus they did become rich.",
  "Helaman 6:12": "They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they did multiply and wax exceeding strong in the land. And they did raise many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.",
  "Helaman 6:13": "Behold, their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine twined linen, and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in peace.",
  "Helaman 6:14": "And in the sixty and fifth year, they did also have great joy and peace; yea, much preaching, and many prophecies concerning that which was to come. And thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.",
  "Helaman 6:15": "And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand, as he sat upon the judgement seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, which had been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended the sixty and sixth year.",
  "Helaman 6:16": "And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year, the people began to grow exceeding wicked again.",
  "Helaman 6:17": "For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the world, that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodsheds; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain, that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob, and to plunder, that they might get gain.—",
  "Helaman 6:18": "And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band which had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s band. But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called Gadianton’s robbers and murderers;",
  "Helaman 6:19": "and it was they which did murder the Chief Judge Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgement seat; and behold, they were not found.",
  "Helaman 6:20": "And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them, they were exceeding sorrowful; and they did use every means whatsoever was in their power, to destroy them off the face of the earth.",
  "Helaman 6:21": "But behold, satan did stir up the hearts of the more parts of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants, and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another, in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed in, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings.",
  "Helaman 6:22": "And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do, he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant;",
  "Helaman 6:23": "and thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms, and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country, and also the laws of their God;",
  "Helaman 6:24": "and whosoever of those which belonged to their band, should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.",
  "Helaman 6:25": "Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants, which Alma commanded his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.",
  "Helaman 6:26": "Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton, by that same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit;",
  "Helaman 6:27": "yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel, it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cain and his followers, from that time forth.",
  "Helaman 6:28": "And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people, to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to Heaven. And it was that same being which led on the people which came from that tower, into this land; which spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell;",
  "Helaman 6:29": "yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton, to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he hath brought it forth from the beginning of man, even down to this time.",
  "Helaman 6:30": "And behold, it is he which is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation, according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.",
  "Helaman 6:31": "And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceeding wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.",
  "Helaman 6:32": "And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them, in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 6:33": "And they did grow in their iniquities, in the sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.",
  "Helaman 6:34": "And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.",
  "Helaman 6:35": "And thus we see that the spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.",
  "Helaman 6:36": "And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his word.",
  "Helaman 6:37": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 6:38": "And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous, until they had come down to believe in their works, and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.",
  "Helaman 6:39": "And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet, and smite, and rend, and turn their backs upon the poor, and the meek, and humble followers of God.",
  "Helaman 6:40": "And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and ripening for an everlasting destruction.",
  "Helaman 6:41": "And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 7:1": "Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla, from the land northward:",
  "Helaman 7:2": "for he had been forth among the people which was in the land northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;",
  "Helaman 7:3": "and they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity;",
  "Helaman 7:4": "and seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgement seats; having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;",
  "Helaman 7:5": "condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished, bacause of their money; and moreover, to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world; and moreover that they might the more easy commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills.",
  "Helaman 7:6": "Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul,",
  "Helaman 7:7": "O that I could have had my days, in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord;",
  "Helaman 7:8": "yea, if my days could have been in them days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.",
  "Helaman 7:9": "But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow, because of this the wickedness of my brethren.",
  "Helaman 7:10": "And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate which led by the highway.",
  "Helaman 7:11": "And it came to pass that there was certain men passing by, and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower, and they ran and told the people what they had seen; and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.",
  "Helaman 7:12": "And now when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people which had gathered together.",
  "Helaman 7:13": "And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them, Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your iniquities?",
  "Helaman 7:14": "Yea, because I have got upon my tower, that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities?",
  "Helaman 7:15": "And because of my mourning and lamentation, ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye had ought to marvel, because ye are given away, that the Devil hath got so great hold upon your hearts;",
  "Helaman 7:16": "yea, how could ye have given away to the enticing of him who art seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?",
  "Helaman 7:17": "O repent ye, repent ye! why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye, unto the Lord your God. Why hath he forsaken you?",
  "Helaman 7:18": "It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.",
  "Helaman 7:19": "And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.",
  "Helaman 7:20": "O how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he hath delivered you?",
  "Helaman 7:21": "But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men; yea, and that ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity;",
  "Helaman 7:22": "and for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold this great city, and also all those great citties which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away, that ye shall have no place in them: For behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he hath hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.",
  "Helaman 7:23": "For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not shew unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repenteth of their sins, and hearken unto my words; now therefore I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you, except ye shall repent;",
  "Helaman 7:24": "for behold they are more righteous than you; for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed, except thou shalt repent;",
  "Helaman 7:25": "yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which hath come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which was established by Gadianton;",
  "Helaman 7:26": "yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts, which hath lifted you up beyond that which is good because of your exceeding great riches;",
  "Helaman 7:27": "yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations.",
  "Helaman 7:28": "And except ye repent, ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.",
  "Helaman 7:29": "Behold now I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true, because the Lord God hath made them known unto me; therefore I testify that they shall be.",
  "Helaman 8:1": "And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold there were men which were Judges, which also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people, why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he hath done?",
  "Helaman 8:2": "Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people, and against our law?",
  "Helaman 8:3": "For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which were contrary to the commandments of God.",
  "Helaman 8:4": "And those Judges were angry with him because he spake plain unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless they durst not lay their own hands upon him; for they feared the people, lest they should cry out against them;",
  "Helaman 8:5": "therefore they did cry unto the people, saying, Why do ye suffer this man to revile against us? For behold, he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.",
  "Helaman 8:6": "And now we know that this is impossible; for behold we are powerful, and our cities great; therefore our enemies can have no power over us.",
  "Helaman 8:7": "And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some which did cry out, Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;",
  "Helaman 8:8": "yea, behold all the judgements will come upon us which he hath testified unto us; for we know that he hath testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities. And behold they are many; and he knoweth as well all things which shall befal us as he knoweth of our iniquities;",
  "Helaman 8:9": "yea, and behold if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.",
  "Helaman 8:10": "And it came to pass that those people which sought to destroy Nephi, were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him. Therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.",
  "Helaman 8:11": "Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them, saying: Behold my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, which were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians, and swallowed them up?",
  "Helaman 8:12": "And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgements that shall come upon you except ye repent?",
  "Helaman 8:13": "But behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which hath been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which was spoken by this man, Moses, which had such great power given unto him; yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.",
  "Helaman 8:14": "Yea, did he not bear record, that the Son of God should come?— And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up which should come.",
  "Helaman 8:15": "And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God, with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.—",
  "Helaman 8:16": "And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his day even to the days of Abraham.",
  "Helaman 8:17": "Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness, and did rejoice.",
  "Helaman 8:18": "Yea, and behold I say unto you, That Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham which were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shewn unto the people a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.",
  "Helaman 8:19": "And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham, there hath been many prophets that hath testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenas did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.",
  "Helaman 8:20": "And behold, also Zenoch, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, ( Jeremiah being that same prophet which testified of the destruction of Jerusalem. ) And now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed, according to the words of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?",
  "Helaman 8:21": "And now will ye dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all.",
  "Helaman 8:22": "Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem, because he testified of these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.",
  "Helaman 8:23": "And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.",
  "Helaman 8:24": "And now seeing ye know these things, and cannot deny them, except ye shall lie. therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in Heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.",
  "Helaman 8:25": "But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treusures in Heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgement;",
  "Helaman 8:26": "yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders, and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent, it will come unto you soon;",
  "Helaman 8:27": "yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgement seat, and search; and behold, your Judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgement seat.",
  "Helaman 8:28": "And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is Gadianton, and the evil one which seeketh to destroy the souls of men.",
  "Helaman 9:1": "Behold now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men which were among them ran to the judgement seat; yea, even there were five which went; and they said among themselves, as they went,",
  "Helaman 9:2": "Behold, now we will know of a surety, whether this man be a prophet, and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvellous things unto us. Behold we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he hath said concerning the Chief Judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he hath spoken is true.",
  "Helaman 9:3": "And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgement seat; and behold the Chief Judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie in his blood.",
  "Helaman 9:4": "And now behold, when they saw this, they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the Chief Judge;",
  "Helaman 9:5": "but now when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them, lest all the judgements which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.",
  "Helaman 9:6": "Now immediately when the Judge had been murdered: he being stabbed by his brother, by a garb of secrecy; and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them.",
  "Helaman 9:7": "And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of the judgement seat; and behold, to their astonishment, they saw those five men which had fallen to the earth.",
  "Helaman 9:8": "And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude which had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves, These men are they which have murdered the Judge, and God hath smitten them that they could not flee from us.",
  "Helaman 9:9": "And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them, and cast them into prison. And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the Judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken, and was cast into prison.",
  "Helaman 9:10": "And it came to pass that on the morrow, the people did assemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great and Chief Judge, which had been slain.",
  "Helaman 9:11": "And thus were also those Judges which were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.",
  "Helaman 9:12": "And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying, Where are the five which was sent to inquire concerning the Chief Judge whether he was dead? And they answered and said, Concerning this five which ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five, which are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.",
  "Helaman 9:13": "And it came to pass that the Judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five which were sent; and behold the Judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying,",
  "Helaman 9:14": "We ran and came to the place of the judgement, and when we saw all things, even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished, insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.",
  "Helaman 9:15": "Now as for the murder of this man, we know not who hath done it, and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead according to the words of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 9:16": "And now it came to pass, that the Judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying, Behold we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the Judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet;",
  "Helaman 9:17": "and now behold we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this Judge.",
  "Helaman 9:18": "And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial. Nevertheless, they did rebuke the Judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.",
  "Helaman 9:19": "Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways, that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death;",
  "Helaman 9:20": "saying unto him, Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault, saying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.",
  "Helaman 9:21": "But Nephi saith unto them, O ye fools, ye uncircumsised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiff-necked people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this your ways of sin?",
  "Helaman 9:22": "O ye had ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great destruction at this time which doth await you, except ye shall repent.",
  "Helaman 9:23": "Behold, ye say that I have agreed with a man, that he should murder Seezoram, our Chief Judge. But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you, that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the wickedness and abominations which is among you.",
  "Helaman 9:24": "And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; yea, because I shewed unto you this sign, ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.",
  "Helaman 9:25": "And now behold, I will shew unto you another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.",
  "Helaman 9:26": "Behold I say unto you, Go to the house of Seantum, which is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto him,",
  "Helaman 9:27": "Hath Nephi, the pretended prophet, which doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, which is your brother?",
  "Helaman 9:28": "And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.",
  "Helaman 9:29": "And ye shall say unto him, Have ye murdered your brother?",
  "Helaman 9:30": "And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say. And behold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent.",
  "Helaman 9:31": "But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak.",
  "Helaman 9:32": "And when ye have seen this, ye shall say, From whence cometh this blood? Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?",
  "Helaman 9:33": "And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.",
  "Helaman 9:34": "And then shall ye say, Because of this fear and this paleness which hath come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.",
  "Helaman 9:35": "And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that he hath done this murder.",
  "Helaman 9:36": "And then shall he say unto you, That I, Nephi, know nothing concerning the matter, save it were given unto me by the power of God. And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you from God.",
  "Helaman 9:37": "And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto them. And behold, the words which he had said, were true: for according to the words, he did deny; and also according to the words, he did confess.",
  "Helaman 9:38": "And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty; and also was Nephi.",
  "Helaman 9:39": "And there were some of the Nephites which believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, which believed, because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.",
  "Helaman 9:40": "And now there were some among the people, which said that Nephi was a prophet;",
  "Helaman 9:41": "and there were others which said, Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god, he could not know of all things. For behold, he hath told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also hath told us things; and even he hath brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our Chief Judge.",
  "Helaman 10:1": "And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither, and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.",
  "Helaman 10:2": "And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shewn unto him.",
  "Helaman 10:3": "And it came to pass as he was thus pondering,— being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities— and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him, saying:",
  "Helaman 10:4": "Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done: for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hath sought my will, and to keep my commandments.",
  "Helaman 10:5": "And now because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.",
  "Helaman 10:6": "Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angles, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.",
  "Helaman 10:7": "Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth, shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.",
  "Helaman 10:8": "And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple, It shall be rent in twain, and it shall be done.",
  "Helaman 10:9": "And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, and it shall be done.",
  "Helaman 10:10": "And behold, if ye shall say, That God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.—",
  "Helaman 10:11": "And now behold, I command you that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent, ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction.",
  "Helaman 10:12": "And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop, and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes which were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord, which had been spoken unto him concerning their destruction, if they did not repent.",
  "Helaman 10:13": "Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the Chief Judge, they did harden their hearts, and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord;",
  "Helaman 10:14": "therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord: Ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.—",
  "Helaman 10:15": "And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts, and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him, that they might cast him into prison.",
  "Helaman 10:16": "But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison: for he was taken by the spirit, and conveyed away out of the midst of them.",
  "Helaman 10:17": "And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.",
  "Helaman 10:18": "And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves, and began to slay one another with the sword.",
  "Helaman 10:19": "And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 11:1": "And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the Judges, that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 11:2": "And it was this secret band of robbers which did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness. And this war did last all that year. And in the seventy and third year it did also last.",
  "Helaman 11:3": "And it came to pass that in this year, Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:",
  "Helaman 11:4": "O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee;",
  "Helaman 11:5": "and so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.— And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi. And thus, in the seventy and fourth year, the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword, but became sore by famine.",
  "Helaman 11:6": "And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year. For the earth was smitten, that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands, in the more wicked parts of the land.",
  "Helaman 11:7": "And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 11:8": "And the people began to plead with their Chief Judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi, Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God, that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction, be fulfilled.",
  "Helaman 11:9": "And it came to pass that the Judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.— And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented, and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:",
  "Helaman 11:10": "O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them, insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.",
  "Helaman 11:11": "Now, O Lord, because of this their humility, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed?",
  "Helaman 11:12": "O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land?",
  "Helaman 11:13": "O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit and her grain, in the season of grain?",
  "Helaman 11:14": "O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words: for thou saidst, That if this people repent, I will spare them;",
  "Helaman 11:15": "yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine, and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.",
  "Helaman 11:16": "And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.",
  "Helaman 11:17": "And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year, the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain, in the season of her grain.",
  "Helaman 11:18": "And behold, the people did rejoice, and glorify God; and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.",
  "Helaman 11:19": "And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.",
  "Helaman 11:20": "And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west, to the sea east.",
  "Helaman 11:21": "And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceeding great peace in the land. And thus ended the seventy and seventh year.",
  "Helaman 11:22": "And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.",
  "Helaman 11:23": "And in the seventy and ninth year, there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren, which knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.",
  "Helaman 11:24": "And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, which had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and took upon themselves the name of Lamanites; and also, a certain number which were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.",
  "Helaman 11:25": "And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them;",
  "Helaman 11:26": "and thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceeding great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.",
  "Helaman 11:27": "Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.",
  "Helaman 11:28": "And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness, and upon the mountains, to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.",
  "Helaman 11:29": "But behold, it came to pass that in that same year, they were driven back even into their own lands. And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 11:30": "And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year, they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction;",
  "Helaman 11:31": "and they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness, and out of the mountains, unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers which infested the mountains and the wilderness.—",
  "Helaman 11:32": "And it came to pass that thus ended this year. And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people, upon all the face of the land;",
  "Helaman 11:33": "yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness; yea, and more especially their women and their children.",
  "Helaman 11:34": "Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord their God.",
  "Helaman 11:35": "And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 11:36": "And in the eighty and second year, they began again to forget the Lord their God. And in the eighty and third year, they began to wax strong in iniquity.— And in the eighty and fourth year, they did not mend their ways.",
  "Helaman 11:37": "And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year, they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction.",
  "Helaman 11:38": "And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.",
  "Helaman 12:1": "And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness, doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him;",
  "Helaman 12:2": "yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people; yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks, and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies, that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One; yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceeding great prosperity.",
  "Helaman 12:3": "And thus we see, that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death, and with terror, and with famine, and with all manner of pestilences, they will not remember him.",
  "Helaman 12:4": "O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world;",
  "Helaman 12:5": "yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels; yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!",
  "Helaman 12:6": "Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them, notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them; they do set at nought his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.",
  "Helaman 12:7": "O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.",
  "Helaman 12:8": "For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God;",
  "Helaman 12:9": "yea, behold, at his voice doth the hills and the mountains tremble and quake;",
  "Helaman 12:10": "and by the power of his voice, they are broken up and become smooth, yea, even like unto a valley;",
  "Helaman 12:11": "yea, by the power of his voice, doth the whole earth shake;",
  "Helaman 12:12": "yea, by the power of his voice, doth the foundations rock, even to the very centre;",
  "Helaman 12:13": "yea, and if he saith unto the earth, Move, and it is moved;",
  "Helaman 12:14": "yea, if he saith unto the earth, Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours, and it is done;",
  "Helaman 12:15": "and thus according to his word, the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so: for sure it is the earth that moveth, and not the sun.",
  "Helaman 12:16": "And behold, also, if he saith unto the waters of the great deep, Be thou dried up, and it is done.",
  "Helaman 12:17": "Behold, if he saith unto this mountain, Be thou raised up, and come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up, and behold it is done.",
  "Helaman 12:18": "And behold, if a man hideth up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say, Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him that hath hid it up, behold, it shall be accursed;",
  "Helaman 12:19": "and if the Lord shall say, Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever, and behold, no man getteth it henceforth and forever.",
  "Helaman 12:20": "And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man, Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be accursed forever, and it shall be done.",
  "Helaman 12:21": "And if the Lord shall say, Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be cut off from my presence, and he will cause that it shall be so.—",
  "Helaman 12:22": "And wo unto whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.",
  "Helaman 12:23": "Therefore, blessed are they who will repent, and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.",
  "Helaman 12:24": "And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace, for grace according to their works.",
  "Helaman 12:25": "And I would that all men might be saved. But we read that in that great and last day, there are some which shall be cast out; yea, which shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord;",
  "Helaman 12:26": "yea, which shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which saith, They that have done good, shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil, shall have everlasting damnation.— And thus it is. Amen.",
  "Helaman 13:1": "And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.",
  "Helaman 13:2": "And it came to pass that in this year, there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people. And it came to pass that he did preach many-day repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.",
  "Helaman 13:3": "But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come in his heart.",
  "Helaman 13:4": "And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart;",
  "Helaman 13:5": "and he said unto them, Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord, which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people, that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years passeth not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people;",
  "Helaman 13:6": "yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people, save it be repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, which surely shall come into the world, and shall suffer many things, and shall be slain for his people.",
  "Helaman 13:7": "And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul. And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive me,",
  "Helaman 13:8": "therefore thus saith the Lord, Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them;",
  "Helaman 13:9": "and four hundred years shall not pass away, before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence;",
  "Helaman 13:10": "yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth generation, which shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come, except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.",
  "Helaman 13:11": "But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God, I will turn away mine anger saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, Blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not;",
  "Helaman 13:12": "yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold it is because of they which are righteous, that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, For I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.",
  "Helaman 13:13": "But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare. But behold if it were not for the righteous which are in this great city, behold I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven, and destroy it.",
  "Helaman 13:14": "But behold, it is for the righteous’ sake, that it is spared. But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which is in her;",
  "Helaman 13:15": "yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness and abominations which is in her;",
  "Helaman 13:16": "yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land round about, which is possessed by the Nephites, because of the wickedness and abominations which is in them;",
  "Helaman 13:17": "and behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts, because of the people’s sake which is upon the land; yea, because of their wickedness and their abominations.",
  "Helaman 13:18": "And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth, shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man, and shall hide it up unto the Lord:",
  "Helaman 13:19": "For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hideth not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasure unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.",
  "Helaman 13:20": "And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, I will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies, because they will not hide them up unto me; cursed be they, and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.",
  "Helaman 13:21": "Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and hath not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you.",
  "Helaman 13:22": "Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your heart is not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities:",
  "Helaman 13:23": "For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches; and this because of your iniquities;",
  "Helaman 13:24": "yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrriven, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.",
  "Helaman 13:25": "And now when ye talk, ye say, If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, ye would not have slain the prophets; ye would not have stoned them, and cast them out.",
  "Helaman 13:26": "Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you, and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out, and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the Devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil.",
  "Helaman 13:27": "But behold, if a man shall come among you, and shall say, Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that, and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say, walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth; and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and ye will say that he is a prophet;",
  "Helaman 13:28": "yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, and then ye will not find fault with him.",
  "Helaman 13:29": "O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you; yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be lead by foolish and blind guides; yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light;",
  "Helaman 13:30": "yea, behold the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land, because of your iniquity;",
  "Helaman 13:31": "and behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that it becometh slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them;",
  "Helaman 13:32": "and in the days of your poverty, ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye lament, and say,",
  "Helaman 13:33": "O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out; yea, in that day shall ye say, O that we had remembered the Lord our God, in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery, that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.",
  "Helaman 13:34": "Behold, we layeth a tool here, and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.",
  "Helaman 13:35": "Yea, we have hid up our treasures, and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.",
  "Helaman 13:36": "O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.",
  "Helaman 13:37": "Behold we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in them days.",
  "Helaman 13:38": "But behold, your days of probation is past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation, until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.",
  "Helaman 13:39": "O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words. And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.",
  "Helaman 14:1": "And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.",
  "Helaman 14:2": "And behold, he saith unto them, Behold, I give unto you a sign: for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.",
  "Helaman 14:3": "And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in Heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh, there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day;",
  "Helaman 14:4": "therefore there shall be one day and a night, and a day, as if it were one day, and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun, and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.",
  "Helaman 14:5": "And behold there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.",
  "Helaman 14:6": "And behold this is not all: there shall be many signs and wonders in Heaven.",
  "Helaman 14:7": "And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.",
  "Helaman 14:8": "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.",
  "Helaman 14:9": "And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me, Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.",
  "Helaman 14:10": "And now because I am a Lamanite, and hath spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me, and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.",
  "Helaman 14:11": "And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent I have come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgements of God which doth await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;",
  "Helaman 14:12": "and also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things, from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.",
  "Helaman 14:13": "And if ye believe on his name, ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.",
  "Helaman 14:14": "And behold, again another sign I give unto you; yea, a sign of his death;",
  "Helaman 14:15": "for behold, he surely must die, that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him, and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord;",
  "Helaman 14:16": "yea, behold this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death; that spiritual death for all mankind, by the fall of Adam, being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.",
  "Helaman 14:17": "But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord;",
  "Helaman 14:18": "yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth, the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not, is hewn down and cast into the fire, and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness;",
  "Helaman 14:19": "therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them, ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.",
  "Helaman 14:20": "But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death: behold, in that day that he shall suffer death, the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon, and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead;",
  "Helaman 14:21": "yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble, and the rocks which is upon the face of this earth, which is both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time is solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;",
  "Helaman 14:22": "yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams, and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth; yea, both above the earth and both beneath.",
  "Helaman 14:23": "And behold there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places, which are now called valleys, which shall become mountains, whose height thereof is great.",
  "Helaman 14:24": "And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate,",
  "Helaman 14:25": "and many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.",
  "Helaman 14:26": "And behold thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me, That there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours;",
  "Helaman 14:27": "and he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth, for the space of three days.",
  "Helaman 14:28": "And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass, upon all the face of this land; to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men;",
  "Helaman 14:29": "and this to the intent that whosoever will believe, might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgement might come upon them; and also if they are condemned, they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.",
  "Helaman 14:30": "And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge, and he hath made you free;",
  "Helaman 14:31": "he hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death, and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.",
  "Helaman 15:1": "And now my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye shall repent, your houses shall be left unto you desolate;",
  "Helaman 15:2": "yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee, and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy, and cannot flee; therefore they shall be trodden down, and shall be left to perish;",
  "Helaman 15:3": "yea, wo unto this people which are called the people of Nephi, except they shall repent when they shall see all those signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them, because he loveth them.",
  "Helaman 15:4": "But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated, because their deeds have been evil continually; and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers. But behold, salvation hath come unto them, through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.",
  "Helaman 15:5": "And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgements, according to the law of Moses.",
  "Helaman 15:6": "Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving, with unwearied diligence, that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many which do add to their numbers daily.",
  "Helaman 15:7": "And behold ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are lead to believe the Holy Scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them;",
  "Helaman 15:8": "therefore as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves, are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.—",
  "Helaman 15:9": "And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up, lest by any means they shall sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin; for behold, they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them; and this because of their faith in Christ.",
  "Helaman 15:10": "And now because of their steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe; for because of their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold the Lord shall bless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their iniquity;",
  "Helaman 15:11": "yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief, the Lord shall prolong their days until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites again, to the knowledge of the truth;",
  "Helaman 15:12": "yea, I say unto you, That in the latter times, the promises of the Lord hath been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful unto them;",
  "Helaman 15:13": "and this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and their true Shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.",
  "Helaman 15:14": "Therefore I say unto you, It shall be better for them than for you, except ye repent.",
  "Helaman 15:15": "For behold, had the mighty works been shewn unto them which have been shewn unto you; yea, unto them which have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves, that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief;",
  "Helaman 15:16": "therefore, saith the Lord, I will not utterly destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom, they shall return again unto me, saith the Lord.",
  "Helaman 15:17": "And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites, if they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief, notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth, shall these things be, saith the Lord.",
  "Helaman 16:1": "And now it came to pass that there were many which heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city. And as many as believed on his words, went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had came forth and found him, they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.",
  "Helaman 16:2": "But as many as there were which did not believe in the words of Samuel, were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him, as he stood upon the wall; but the spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones, neither with their arrows.",
  "Helaman 16:3": "Now when they saw this, that they could not hit him, there were many more which did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.",
  "Helaman 16:4": "For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people; shewing signs and wonders; working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come;",
  "Helaman 16:5": "telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming, that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel, went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.",
  "Helaman 16:6": "But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried out unto their captains, saying, Take this fellow and bind him, for behold, he hath a Devil; and because of the power of the Devil which is in him, we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.",
  "Helaman 16:7": "And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.",
  "Helaman 16:8": "And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.",
  "Helaman 16:9": "And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 16:10": "And thus ended, also, the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the Judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.",
  "Helaman 16:11": "And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 16:12": "And there were but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges.",
  "Helaman 16:13": "But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled;",
  "Helaman 16:14": "and angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the Scriptures began to be fulfilled.",
  "Helaman 16:15": "Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength, and upon their own wisdom, saying:",
  "Helaman 16:16": "Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvellous works cannot come to pass, of which hath been spoken.",
  "Helaman 16:17": "And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying,",
  "Helaman 16:18": "That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, as it hath been spoken, why will he not shew himself unto us, as well as unto they which shall be at Jerusalem?",
  "Helaman 16:19": "Yea, why will he not shew himself in this land, as well as in the land of Jerusalem?",
  "Helaman 16:20": "But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvellous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.",
  "Helaman 16:21": "And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery, which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them for to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance, if we will yield ourselves unto them all the days of our lives.",
  "Helaman 16:22": "And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about, spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good, and against that which should come;",
  "Helaman 16:23": "and notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which was wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people, upon all the face of the land.",
  "Helaman 16:24": "And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.",
  "Helaman 16:25": "And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons."
